## Timekeeper

The public API for Easy Timekeeping.

### getPhaseOfDay

Get the name of the current phase of the day as a localised string.

Not to be confused with the four shifts, the phase of day relates
to the daylight cycle. During the day phase, the scene lighting
will be set to the day value. During the night, scene lighting is
set to the night value. During dawn, lighting is gradually changed
from the night to the day values, while during dusk, the lighting
changes from the day to night values.

Returns **[string][21]** the localised name of the day phase.
This is one of the set `[Dawn, Day, Dusk, Night]`, but localized.

### increment

Increment or decrement the time.
You must be a GM to run this function.

#### Parameters

*   `time` **[time][9]** the time step to increment or decrement

Returns **[timeChangeData][15]** if the time was changed, otherwise `false`.

### set

Set the time.
You must be a GM to run this function.

#### Parameters

*   `time` **[time][9]** the time to set

Returns **[timeChangeData][15]** if the time was changed, otherwise `false`.

### getTime

Gets the current time.

Returns **[timeAugmented][11]** the current time

### tellTime

Posts the current time to chat.

### factorGameTurns

Factors a time object into game turns, shifts and days

#### Parameters

*   `totalMinutes` &#x20;

#### Properties

*   `totalMinutes` **[number][22]** total elapsed minutes since 12am on day 0

Returns **[gameTurnTime][17]** `totalMinutes` factored into game turns, shifts, days and weeks

### factorTime

Factors a time in total minutes into a time object.
This API method has no side-effects, and does not change the internal
time state.

#### Parameters

*   `totalMinutes` **[number][22]** The total number of minutes since 0:00 on day 0

Returns **[timeAugmented][11]**&#x20;

## time
