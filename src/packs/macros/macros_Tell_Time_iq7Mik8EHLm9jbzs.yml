  Posts the current time to chat. 

  This API function does exactly the same thing as the chat button on the UI.

  If a user doesn't have permission to see the time, they'll just get a warning.

  /*

  The tellTime API method also takes a time or timeAugmented data object as an
  optional parameter.

  If it receives one, it will display that time as a formatted chat message
  instead of the current time.


  It can be tricky to correctly build one of the data objects by hand due to all
  the integer math that 

  needs to be just right. The most common way I've used them is for calculating
  differences between times,

  often as an offset from the current time. The safest way is to get the
  starting point, convert everything

  into minutes and do the addition or subtraction, then use the factorTime API
  method to convert the total

  number of minutes since 12am on day 0 to a timeAugmented object which can be
  posted to chat.


  It's much simpler than it sounds. Here's an example that calculates the
  duration in hours of a jump in 

  the Traveller RPG, converts that to minutes, adds the duration to the current
  time, then posts the expected

  end time of the jump as a chat message.

  // Calculate a random jump duration in hours for Mongoose Traveller using a
  Foundry dice roll

  const jumpDurationHours = await new Roll('6d6+148').evaluate()  

  const jumpDurationMinutes = jumpDurationHours.total * 60  // 60 minutes to an
  hour


  // get the current time

  let time = await game.modules.get('jd-easytimekeeping').api.getTime()


  // add the jump duration in minutes to the current time in total minutes since
  12am on day 0

  // and factor that into a timeAugmented object

  time = game.modules.get('jd-easytimekeeping').api.factorTime(time.totalMinutes
  + jumpDurationMinutes)


  // display the time to chat

  game.modules.get('jd-easytimekeeping').api.tellTime(time)
