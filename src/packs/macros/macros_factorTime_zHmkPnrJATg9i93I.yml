  Testing the API function to factor a number in total minutes into a
  timeAugmented data object.


  See:
  https://github.com/DC23/jd-easytimekeeping/blob/main/documentation/timekeeper.md#timeaugmented


  One use is to accurately calculate a future time. I'm using this in my
  Traveller game to work out the end date of a Jump based on the current time
  and day and the jump duration of 6d6+148 hours.

  */


  // Calculate the duration of Traveller jump. It's 6d6+148 hours

  let jumpDurationHours = await new Roll('6d6+148').evaluate()


  // the jump duration in minutes (60 minutes to an hour)

  const jumpDurationMinutes = jumpDurationHours.total * 60


  // The duration in whole minutes is good, but it's easier to display in days,
  hours and minutes

  const duration =
  game.modules.get('jd-easytimekeeping').api.factorTime(jumpDurationMinutes)


  ui.notifications.notify(`The jump will take ${duration.days} days,
  ${duration.hours} hours.`)
